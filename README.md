# About
An Android Q&A educational flashcard application in development. Questions and answers are currently hard-coded and cover material of various standard courses of an undergraduate computer science degree.

This app would naturally also work well with any other broader topic - but questions designed by me, for now, will exclusively be covering materials of computer science at Eastern Michigan University for now. Feel free to submit a pull request to add additional categories and questions.

Future roadmap may be to make this app competitive to other existing alternatives for community flashcard browsers, such as Quizlet - perhaps specialized still to computer science.

## UI Examples
UI to continue to improve throughout development, light and dark mode toggle as a future-feature.
