# About
An extremely simple Android Q&amp;A educational application in development aimed to fit this niche: you want to study data structures and algorithims but you're otherwise unable to divert your attention(i.e. long repetitive driving). Questions and answers are designed to be understood when another person, who doesn't necessarily have to understand computer science, reads them aloud. Have someone quiz you with this app!
