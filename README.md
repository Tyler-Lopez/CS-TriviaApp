# About
A simple Android Q&amp;A educational flashcard application in development aimed to fit this niche: you want to study computer science but you're otherwise unable to divert your attention(i.e. long repetitive driving). Questions and answers are designed to be understood when another person, who doesn't necessarily have to understand computer science, reads them aloud. Have someone quiz you with this app!

This app would naturally also work well with any other broader topic - but questions designed by me will exclusively be covering materials of computer science at Eastern Michigan University for now. Feel free to submit a pull request to add additional categories and questions.
